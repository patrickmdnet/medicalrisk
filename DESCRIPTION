Description: Generates risk estimates and comorbidity flags from ICD-9-CM
    codes available in administrative medical datasets. The package supports
    the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Elixhauser Comorbidity
    classification, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, and the Risk Stratification
    Index.  Methods are table-based, fast, and use the 'plyr' package, so
    parallelization is possible for large jobs. Also includes a sample of
    real ICD-9 data for 100 patients from a publicly available dataset.
